# Insanity-Gym--Project1
HTML/SCSS/JavaScript

- Hi Everyone

This is the first project of my portfolio, its a website created for an imaginary gym in london. My main learning objective for this project was to practice simple DOM manipulation and page structuring. Any advise would be more than welcome, thank you for taking the time to look at my code.
